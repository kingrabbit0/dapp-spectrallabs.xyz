                        must first send to the other party a written Notice of
                        Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) describing the

                        requested relief.  Each party hereby irrevocably and
                        unconditionally consents to service of process through
                        personal service at their corporate headquarters,

                        the right of any party to serve process in any other
                        manner permitted by Law. After the Notice is received,
                        you and Tensor may attempt to resolve the claim or
                        dispute informally.  If you and Tensor do not resolve
                        the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the
                        Notice is received, either party may begin an
                        arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement
                        offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the
                        arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the
                        amount of the award, if any, to which either party is
                        entitled.

                        <strong>Arbitration Rules.  </strong>Arbitration shall
                        be initiated through the American Arbitration
                        Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), an established
                        alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”)
                        that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. 
                        If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall
                        agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules
                        of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the
                        arbitration, including but not limited to the method of
                        initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the
                        extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The
                        AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”)
                        governing the arbitration are available online at
                        www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. 
                        The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral
                        arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total
                        amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand
                        U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through
                        binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option
                        of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes
                        where the total amount of the award sought is Ten
                        Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right
                        to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration
                        Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within
                        100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside
                        of the United States, and unless the parties agree
                        otherwise.  If you reside outside of the U.S., the
                        arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of
                        the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any
                        judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
                        entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If the
                        arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the
                        last settlement offer that Tensor made to you prior to
                        the initiation of arbitration, Tensor will pay you the
                        greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall
                        bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and
                        disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall
                        pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR

                        matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The
                        arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions
                        dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator
                        shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and
                        to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to
                        an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and
                        the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award
                        and statement of decision describing the essential
                        findings and conclusions on which the award is based,
                        including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The
                        arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
                        individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
                        have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding
                        upon you and Tensor.
